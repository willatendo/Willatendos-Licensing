## Assets:
The assets for any of my mods are under All Rights Reserved. To put it simply, you cannot use them for your purposes. However, some of my mods include assets, mainly 3d art, that is made by separate people. Their wishes and licenses apply as they wish. Contact me to direct you to them to ask, but just assume you cannot use them. Additonally, some 2d assets used in the Lost Worlds mod are made by Santipik3 who has given them to other devs.
